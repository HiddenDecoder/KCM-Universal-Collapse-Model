## 1. INTRODUCTION  
The Karnav Collapse Model (KCM) is a universal 0-1-C architecture describing how all systems —  
mathematical, physical, digital, cognitive, organizational — transition from instability to stability  
through a collapse mechanism known as the **C-State**.

KCM unifies five domains:  
- Collapse Physics  
- AI & Decision Systems  
- Logic & Computation  
- Hardware & Metastability  
- Mathematical Stability (includes RH-mapping)

## 2. THE UNIVERSAL 0-1-C CYCLE  
All systems evolve through a fundamental three-state cycle:

**0 — Center:**  
Stillness, equilibrium, truth-state, fixed-point.

**1 — Wave:**  
Activity, signal propagation, patterns, variations, distortion.

**C — Collapse:**  
Resolution event that selects the nearest valid stable configuration and returns the system toward a truth-aligned state.

**Core Law:**  
Every contradiction, instability or undecidable configuration *collapses to the nearest center*.

---

## 3. THE C-STATE (COLLAPSE LAW)  
The C-State is the universal resolution mechanism.

### **C-State Definition**  
A system is in C-State when:  
1. Instability > threshold  
2. Multiple possible continuations exist  
3. Only *one* continuation is stability-valid  
4. The system collapses to that minimum-energy, minimum-contradiction point.

### **C-State Properties**  
- Deterministic at the center  
- Probabilistic at the wave  
- Stability-seeking  
- Time-minimizing  
- Contradiction-eliminating  
- Unique for a given structure

---

## 4. KRP ROOT SYSTEM  
KCM uses **four universal roots** to resolve any input:

### **MeaningRoot (MR)**  
Determines what the input *means* in the system.

### **RouteRoot (RR)**  
Determines which paths are structurally possible.

### **TrustRoot (TR)**  
Determines which paths are consistent with system integrity.

### **TimeRoot (TmR)**  
Determines which path resolves fastest toward stability.

**Flow:**  
Input → MR → RR → TR → TmR → C-State → Output

## 5. KCM COLLAPSE ENGINE (ABSTRACT SPEC)  
The collapse engine performs:

1. Parse input  
2. Map through four KRP roots  
3. Detect instability + contradictions  
4. Compute center-proximity  
5. Resolve collapse → output

### **Mathematical Form (informal)**  
Let `E(x)` = stability energy of configuration x  
Collapse selects `x*` such that:

x* = argmin E(x) subject to system constraints

This energy-minimum formulation is the core of KCM.

## 6. UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS  

### **1. PHYSICS**  
Wave → collapse → stable state  
Direct mapping to:
- quantum measurements  
- metastability  
- equilibrium dynamics  

### **2. AI & DECISION SYSTEMS**  
C-State = deterministic decision output  
Replaces probability-based ambiguity with stability-based selection.

### **3. LOGIC & COMPUTATION**  
C-State = fixed-point resolution  
Applicable to halting-style problems inside bounded frames.

### **4. HARDWARE**  
Maps to metastability resolution in flip-flops and arbiters.

### **5. RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS MAPPING**  
KCM views zeta zeros as collapse equilibria:  
Wave instabilities collapse onto a single symmetric center-line (σ = 1/2).
