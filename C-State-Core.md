## 1. OVERVIEW  
The **C-State** is the universal collapse point in the Karnav Collapse Model (KCM).  
It is the moment where instability resolves into stability, ambiguity becomes clarity,  
and a single valid output is selected from many possible continuations.

The C-State is not a “random choice” —  
it is a **mathematically necessary collapse** toward the nearest stability-center.

---

## 2. FORMAL DEFINITION  
A system S enters C-State when the following four conditions hold:

1. **Instability exceeds threshold**  
   There is more contradiction than the structure can carry.

2. **Multiple valid continuations exist**  
   The system cannot stay in Wave-state (1).

3. **A unique stability-minimum exists**  
   Only one configuration satisfies center-alignment.

4. **Collapse is required for resolution**  
   Without collapse, the system cannot progress.

---

## 3. THE C-STATE RESOLUTION RULE  
Collapse selects the configuration x* such that:

x* = argmin E(x)

Where:  
- **E(x)** = stability energy  
- Lower energy = closer to center  
- x* = unique valid stable state

This is the backbone of KCM.

## 4. C-STATE ALGORITHM (ABSTRACT)  
Step 1 — Detect contradiction  
Step 2 — Measure instability magnitude  
Step 3 — Identify allowable configurations  
Step 4 — Compute stability distances  
Step 5 — Select minimum-energy state (collapse)  
Step 6 — Return final output

This algorithm powers the KRP Engine & Simulator.

## 5. C-STATE PROPERTIES  
### **1. Deterministic at center**  
Collapse outcome is fixed when center alignment is clear.

### **2. Probabilistic at wave**  
Before collapse, multiple outcomes appear possible.

### **3. Time-minimal**  
Collapse takes the shortest path to stability.

### **4. Structure-consistent**  
Collapse never violates system constraints.

### **5. Universally applicable**  
Physics • AI • Logic • Hardware • Cognition • Mathematics

## 6. DOMAIN MAPPINGS  

### **Physics**  
Wave → collapse → eigenstate

### **AI**  
Uncertain inputs → collapse → deterministic output

### **Hardware**  
Metastability → arbiter collapse → final logic level

### **Mathematics**  
Unbounded behaviours → collapse → unique fixed-point  
(RH mapping relies on this.)

## 7. ROLE IN RH MAPPING  
C-State models zeta-zero collapses as:

Wave instability → symmetric collapse → σ = 1/2

Meaning the critical line is the center of minimal contradiction.

Full proof in the RH paper.
