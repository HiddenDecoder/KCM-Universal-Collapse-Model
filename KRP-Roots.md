# KRP ROOT SYSTEM — The Cognitive Architecture of KCM

## 1. OVERVIEW  
The **KRP Root System** is the decision-intelligence layer inside the Karnav Collapse Model (KCM).  
It determines how any input moves from ambiguity (Wave-state) to clarity (C-State).

KRP has **four universal roots**:

1. **MeaningRoot (MR)**  
2. **RouteRoot (RR)**  
3. **TrustRoot (TR)**  
4. **TimeRoot (TmR)**  

All decisions, collapses, and stable outputs are generated through these four roots.

---

## 2. WHY ROOTS EXIST  
Every decision, no matter the domain, must answer four questions:

1. *What does this mean?* → **MeaningRoot**  
2. *What paths are possible?* → **RouteRoot**  
3. *Which path is reliable?* → **TrustRoot**  
4. *Which path resolves fastest?* → **TimeRoot**

This is universal across:
- AI agents  
- humans  
- hardware arbiters  
- mathematical frameworks  
- organizational systems  

---

## 3. ROOT DEFINITIONS  

---

### **1. MeaningRoot (MR)**  
Determines what the input actually *represents*.

**MR identifies:**
- semantic meaning  
- structural meaning  
- contextual meaning  
- functional meaning  

If MR fails → whole system collapses incorrectly.  
MR = “understanding.”

---

### **2. RouteRoot (RR)**  
Determines what *paths* the system can take.

**RR evaluates:**
- all possible continuations  
- allowed transitions  
- structure-valid branches  
- future behaviour ranges  

RR = “available possibilities.”

---

### **3. TrustRoot (TR)**  
Determines which path can be *trusted* to not break the system.

**TR checks:**
- consistency  
- logical coherence  
- structural integrity  
- contradiction risk  
- center-alignment  

TR = “correct path.”

---

### **4. TimeRoot (TmR)**  
Determines which valid path resolves **fastest**.

**TmR evaluates:**
- collapse time  
- effort required  
- complexity  
- friction  
- stability-distance  

TmR = “fastest resolution.”

---

## 4. KRP FLOW  
The universal flow in KCM:

Input
→ MR (What does it mean?)
→ RR (What paths exist?)
→ TR (Which path is valid?)
→ TmR (Which path is fastest?)
→ C-State (Collapse)
→ Output (Truth-aligned decision)

This is the same pattern used by:
- AI decision engines  
- human reasoning  
- logic systems  
- hardware meta-stability resolution  
- RH collapse mapping  

---

## 5. FORMAL STRUCTURE  

Let X = input  
MR(X) = semantic mapping  
RR(X) = possible continuations  
TR(X) = valid continuation set  
TmR(X) = minimal-time continuation  

Final collapse result:

Output = Collapse( TmR( TR( RR( MR(X) ) ) ) )

This is the **KCM decision equation.**

---

## 6. WHY KRP IS UNIVERSAL  
Because every decision in every system must choose:

- meaning  
- available path  
- trustworthy path  
- fastest path  

This is the only structure that satisfies all systems from physics to logic to AI.

---

## 7. ROLE IN C-STATE  
C-State is the point of collapse.  
KRP is the **path that leads to collapse.**

Without KRP, collapse is blind.  
With KRP, collapse is optimized.

---
