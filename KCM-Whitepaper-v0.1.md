## ABSTRACT
The Karnav Collapse Model (KCM) proposes a universal dynamics law—0, 1, and C—describing how
all natural, cognitive, digital, logical, mathematical, and physical systems transition from instability
to stability.

The model asserts:

- **1 (Wave)** represents exploration, variation, instability, and multi-path propagation.  
- **C (Collapse)** is the universal resolution event where contradictions are eliminated.  
- **0 (Center)** is the symmetry-consistent stability point toward which all systems converge.

KCM provides a unified mathematical structure to describe collapse processes in:
physics, AI decision systems, logic, hardware metastability, cognitive processes, and even analytical
structures such as the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) stability line.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Across disciplines, systems face instability and must “collapse” into a valid state.  
Quantum mechanics, decision theory, neural networks, hardware flip-flops, logical systems, and 
mathematical functions all exhibit collapse-like behaviour.

KCM formalizes this behaviour into a single law:

**All unstable configurations collapse to the nearest symmetry-aligned stability center.**

This “collapse principle” is encoded using:
- the **0–1–C cycle**  
- the **C-State core**  
- the **KRP root system**  
- the **collapse math foundation**

## 2. THE UNIVERSAL 0–1–C CYCLE
### 0 — Center  
Truth • Stillness • Equilibrium • Symmetry • Stability  

### 1 — Wave  
Signals • Distortion • Exploration • Variation  

### C — Collapse  
Resolution • Selection • Stabilization • Output  

**Law:**  
A system transitions **1 → C → 0** when instability > threshold.

This law explains:
- quantum measurement  
- AI decision selection  
- human clarity events  
- hardware metastability  
- mathematical zero-localization

## 3. C-STATE: THE COLLAPSE ENGINE
The C-State is the universal resolution mechanism.

A system enters C-State when:
1. instability rises,  
2. multiple possible continuations exist,  
3. a unique stability-minimum exists,  
4. collapse is structurally required.

Collapse is defined mathematically as:

x* = argmin E(x)

Where **E(x)** = stability energy based on:
- distance from center (D(x))
- contradiction magnitude (C(x))

## 4. THE KRP ROOT SYSTEM (MR → RR → TR → TmR)
KCM defines four universal roots through which all inputs pass:

### 1. MeaningRoot (MR) — What does this mean?  
### 2. RouteRoot (RR) — What paths are possible?  
### 3. TrustRoot (TR) — Which paths maintain structural integrity?  
### 4. TimeRoot (TmR) — Which path resolves fastest?

**Flow:**

Input → MR → RR → TR → TmR → C-State → Output

KRP constrains collapse to the *best possible path*.

## 5. COLLAPSE MATHEMATICS

### 5.1 Stability Energy

E(x) = D(x) + C(x)

- **D(x)** = |x – center|  
- **C(x)** = contradiction magnitude  

### 5.2 Collapse Rule  
The system selects:

x* = argmin E(x)

### 5.3 Symmetry Requirement  
A collapse state is valid only if:

Symmetry(x*) ≥ required threshold

### 5.4 Time Optimization  
Collapse prefers:

argmin T(x)

subject to stability correctness.  

Thus collapse is **energy-minimal + time-minimal**.

## 6. DOMAIN APPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Physics  
Wavefunction → Collapse → Eigenstate  
Quantum measurement is a 0–1–C event.

### 6.2 AI Decision Systems  
Probabilities → Collapse → Deterministic output  
Decision AI becomes stability-based rather than probability-based.

### 6.3 Hardware  
Metastable circuits resolve using collapse into valid logic states.

### 6.4 Cognition  
Overthinking → Collapse → Realization  
Human clarity is a C-State event.

### 6.5 Logic & Computation  
Collapse selects the unique fixed-point that satisfies constraints.

### 6.6 Riemann Hypothesis Mapping  
Non-trivial zeta zeros behave like wave-instabilities.

Collapse forces them to the maximal-symmetry center  
→ **Re(s) = 1/2**  

This line is the unique minimal-contradiction, maximal-symmetry axis.

Full RH mapping is published separately.

## 7. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
KCM consists of five interacting layers:

1. 0-1-C foundational law  
2. C-State collapse core  
3. KRP root intelligence  
4. Collapse mathematics  
5. Application layer (AI, physics, hardware, RH, cognition, logic)

These layers create a universal handling mechanism for all collapse-driven systems.

---

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION
KCM is deployed using:

### 1. KCM Collapse Engine  
Python-based structural engine.

### 2. KCM Simulator  
Web-based visualization of collapse behaviour.

### 3. KCM Model Specification Files  
Included in `/spec`.

### 4. KRP Engine  
Decision engine used in AI & personal clarity systems.

## 9. CONCLUSION
KCM provides the first unified framework describing collapse behaviour across all major fields of 
science and computation.

It is:
- mathematically grounded  
- structurally consistent  
- symmetry-aligned  
- universally applicable  

This makes KCM a foundational candidate for future research in physics, AI, logic, hardware, and 
mathematics.
