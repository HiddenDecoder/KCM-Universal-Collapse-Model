## 1. OVERVIEW  
This document defines the mathematical backbone of the **Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)**.  
Here we formalize how collapse decisions are produced using:

- stability energy  
- contradiction magnitude  
- center-distance  
- symmetry requirements  
- time-optimal selection  

These mathematical principles unify physics, AI, cognition, logic, and the RH collapse mapping.

## 2. STABILITY ENERGY FUNCTION  
Let a system configuration be represented as **x**.  
Define its **stability energy** as:

E(x) = D(x) + C(x)

Where:

- **D(x)** = distance from the nearest center  
- **C(x)** = contradiction magnitude within structure

Lower E(x) = more stable = closer to collapse output.

---

## 3. CENTER-DISTANCE METRIC  
For any configuration x:

D(x) = |x - x_center|

Where **x_center** is the truth-aligned equilibrium point.

- In RH mapping → x_center = σ = 1/2  
- In physics → eigenstate  
- In logic → fixed point  
- In cognition → clarity point  
- In hardware → stable logic level

---

## 4. CONTRADICTION MAGNITUDE  
Contradiction magnitude C(x) measures how much a configuration violates:

- system rules  
- internal consistency  
- structural constraints  

Formally:

C(x) = number_of_violations(x) * weight

This makes collapse strongly prefer low-violation configurations.

---

## 5. COLLAPSE RULE (FORMAL)  
The collapse output x* is defined as:

x* = argmin E(x)

subject to system constraints.

This is the **mathematical core** of C-State.

---

## 6. SYMMETRY REQUIREMENT  
For a collapse to be valid:

Symmetry(x*) ≥ SymmetryThreshold

Meaning the chosen collapse state must satisfy the system’s intrinsic symmetry.  
Example:  
- In RH → σ = 1/2 is maximal-symmetry vertical line.  
- In hardware → metastability resolves into one of two symmetric logic states.  

---

## 7. TIME-OPTIMALITY PRINCIPLE  
Collapse is not only stability-minimal — it is time-minimal.

Define collapse-time T(x):

T(x) = f( D(x), C(x), computational_complexity )

Collapse selects:

x* = argmin T(x) subject to stability validity

This guarantees:

- fastest correct output  
- least energy waste  
- universal efficiency

## 8. WAVE → COLLAPSE → CENTER MATH FLOW  
1. Wave state explores large behaviour space  
2. Instability rises  
3. Contradictions accumulate  
4. Collapse energy minimized  
5. Unique x* emerges  
6. System stabilizes (0-state)

This is mathematically identical across domains.

---

## 9. RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS MAPPING  
Under KCM:

- Non-trivial zeros behave like instability points  
- Collapse pulls them toward the **symmetry center**  
- The line σ = 1/2 minimizes D(x) and maximizes symmetry  
- Therefore collapse forces roots onto the center-line  

This is the analytical backbone of the RH paper.

## 10. STATUS  
This file defines the mathematical foundation of KCM:  
- energy functional  
- contradiction metric  
- collapse optimization  
- symmetry requirement  
- RH mapping basis
