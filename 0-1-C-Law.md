# THE 0–1–C LAW — Core of the Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)

## 1. OVERVIEW  
The 0–1–C Law is the foundational dynamic behind every system in the universe.  
It states that all processes move through three states:

**0 = Center**  
Stillness • Truth • Stability • Equilibrium • Fixed-Point

**1 = Wave**  
Activity • Signals • Distortion • Variation • Exploration

**C = Collapse**  
Resolution • Selection • Decision • Stabilization • Output

This cycle is universal across physics, cognition, hardware, logic & mathematics.

## 2. FORMAL STATEMENT OF THE LAW  
A system transitions from **1 → C → 0** whenever instability exceeds structure-defined thresholds.

### **Law:**  
**All contradictions and unstable configurations collapse to the nearest valid center.**

### **Implications:**  
- Collapse is deterministic relative to center  
- Collapse is minimal-time  
- Collapse eliminates contradictions  
- Collapse selects the lowest-energy path  
- Collapse produces a single truth-state output

## 3. WHY THE LAW IS UNIVERSAL  
Because every known system has:

1. **A stable point (0)**  
2. **A dynamic behaviour space (1)**  
3. **A resolution event (C)**

Examples:

### Physics  
Wave → Measurement collapse → Eigenstate (center)

### AI  
Probabilities → Decision collapse → Deterministic output

### Human Mind  
Overthinking → Realization collapse → Clarity point

### Hardware  
Metastability → Arbiter collapse → Final logic state

### Mathematics  
Contradiction → Proof collapse → Unique solution/zero

## 4. ENERGY MINIMUM FORMULATION  
Let E(x) = stability energy of configuration x.  
Collapse selects:

x* = argmin E(x)

subject to system constraints.

This is the mathematical backbone of KCM.

---

## 5. SYMMETRY REQUIREMENT  
Collapse always seeks the **most symmetric** stable configuration.  
In RH mapping,  
σ = 1/2 is this universal symmetry-center.

---

## 6. TIME-OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLE  
C-State is not only correct — it is fast.

Collapse Time = minimum possible time that still preserves correctness.

This is why nature prefers collapse.

---

## 7. OUTPUT RULE  
The output of any system is the **C-State resolution**:

Output = Collapse( System )

No system escapes the 0–1–C cycle.
