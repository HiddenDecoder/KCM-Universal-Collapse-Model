# KCM SPECIFICATIONS — Complete Model Specification Index  
### Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)  
**Author:** Saurabh Misra (Karnav)

---

## 1. PURPOSE  
This directory contains all **formal specification documents** of the  
**Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)**.

These files define the complete theoretical & mathematical architecture of KCM:
- foundational law  
- collapse-core mechanics  
- intelligence roots (KRP)  
- collapse mathematics  
- system architecture  

Each spec is standalone and citable.

---

## 2. FILE INDEX

### **1. KCM-v1.0.md**  
**Full top-level specification of the entire model.**  
Contains:
- intro to 0–1–C  
- architecture overview  
- logic flow  
- domain mappings  
- system definitions  

This is the *master spec*.

---

### **2. 0-1-C-Law.md**  
Defines the **universal collapse dynamic**:

0 = Center
1 = Wave
C = Collapse

This is the philosophical, physical, and mathematical backbone of KCM.

---

### **3. C-State-Core.md**  
Defines:
- collapse-trigger conditions  
- collapse rule: x* = argmin E(x)  
- stability thresholds  
- contradiction resolution  
- domain mappings (physics, AI, hardware, RH)  

This is the **heart of the engine**.

---

### **4. KRP-Roots.md**  
Defines the **four universal decision roots**:

1. MeaningRoot (MR)  
2. RouteRoot (RR)  
3. TrustRoot (TR)  
4. TimeRoot (TmR)  

The entire decision pipeline of KCM flows through these four roots.

---

### **5. Collapse-Math-Foundation.md**  
Mathematical foundation of collapse:

- stability energy: `E(x) = D(x) + C(x)`  
- distance from center  
- contradiction magnitude  
- symmetry requirements  
- collapse-time minimization  
- RH mapping basis  

This is the **formal analytical backbone** of the theory.
