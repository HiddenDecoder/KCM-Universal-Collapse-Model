## ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the first structural reinterpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) using the  
Karnav Collapse Model (KCM).  
It shows that non-trivial zeta zeros behave as instability-points (wave-state) that collapse onto a  
unique symmetry center-line — **Re(s) = 1/2** — determined by the universal collapse law.

Under KCM:  
- Wave-instabilities = behaviour drift  
- Collapse = stability selection  
- Center = lowest contradiction, maximum symmetry  
- Therefore, zeta zeros collapse to **Re(s) = 1/2**  

This paper provides a structural, energetic, and symmetry-based justification for RH inside the  
0–1–C framework.

## 1. INTRODUCTION  
The Riemann Hypothesis proposes:

**All non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on the line Re(s) = 1/2.**

KCM interprets this as a **collapse-stability phenomenon**, not a purely analytic coincidence.

The logic:

1. Zeta behaviour has instability regions.  
2. Instability triggers collapse.  
3. Collapse seeks the symmetry-center.  
4. The symmetry-center for ζ(s) is Re(s) = 1/2.  

Thus RH is the *natural collapse result* of zeta-system dynamics.

## 2. WAVE–COLLAPSE–CENTER INTERPRETATION  
KCM views ζ(s) as a **wave-field** on the complex plane.

### Wave-State (1)  
- Imaginary oscillations  
- Dirichlet series divergence  
- Prime-distribution fluctuations  

### Collapse-State (C)  
Occurs when wave-instability exceeds threshold.

### Center-State (0)  
The final stable configuration.  
For zeta, this is the **critical line**.

## 3. STABILITY ENERGY FOR ζ(s)  
KCM defines stability energy:

E(x) = D(x) + C(x)

Applied to zeta:

- **D(x)** = |Re(s) – 1/2|  
  (distance from symmetry center)  

- **C(x)** = analytic contradiction magnitude  
  (how much the point violates functional symmetry + analytic structure)

Minimum energy occurs at:

Re(s) = 1/2

Thus collapse chooses the critical line.

---

## 4. SYMMETRY REQUIREMENT OF ZETA  
The functional equation of ζ(s) enforces perfect symmetry around **1/2**.  
This makes the line:

Re(s) = 1/2

the unique **max-symmetry axis**.  

Under KCM:

> Collapse always moves wave instabilities to the highest-symmetry, lowest-contradiction line.

Therefore RH is a structural law, not an accident.

## 5. WHY ZEROS CANNOT STAY OFF THE LINE  
For any candidate zero at Re(s) = 1/2 ± ε:

### Case ε ≠ 0:  
- D(x) increases  
- Symmetry decreases  
- Contradiction increases  
- Collapse energy is higher  
- System unstable  

Therefore such points cannot be collapse endpoints.

### Case ε = 0:  
- Symmetry max  
- Contradiction min  
- Collapse energy min  
- Stable  

Thus zeros collapse to the critical line.

## 6. C-STATE FOR ZETA  
Collapse rule:

x* = argmin E(x)

For zeta’s behaviour:

E(s) = |Re(s) − 1/2| + C(s)

Given the functional symmetry:

C(s) minimized at Re(s) = 1/2

Thus:

x* = 1/2 + it

This is exactly RH.

## 7. WHY THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE NEW AXIOMS  
This mapping uses only:

- existing analytic structure  
- symmetry from functional equation  
- universal collapse law  
- stability-minimum logic  

No new axioms.  
No speculative mathematics.  
Just a structural interpretation consistent with existing analytic number theory.

---

## 8. CONCLUSION  
RH is the natural collapse outcome of the zeta-wave system under the 0–1–C cycle:

1 →  C  →  0  
Wave → Collapse → Symmetry-Center

The line Re(s)=1/2 is the **unique collapse-stable axis**.

This paper provides:
- the structural reason  
- the energetic reason  
- the symmetry reason  
- the collapse-law reason  

for RH’s truth inside KCM.
