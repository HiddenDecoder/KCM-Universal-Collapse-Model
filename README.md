# KARNAV COLLAPSE MODEL (KCM)
### Universal 0–1–C Architecture for Collapse-Based Systems  
**Creator:** Saurabh Misra (Karnav)

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION  
The **Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)** is a universal framework describing how all systems  
— physical, cognitive, computational, logical, mathematical —  
transition from instability to stability using the 0–1–C dynamic:

1 = Wave-State (exploration, variation, instability)
C = Collapse-State (resolution, decision, stabilization)
0 = Center-State (truth-alignment, symmetry, equilibrium)

KCM unifies:

- Collapse behaviour in quantum physics  
- Decision selection in AI  
- Fixed-point convergence in logic  
- Metastability resolution in hardware  
- Human cognitive clarity  
- Riemann Hypothesis zero-collapse mapping  

This repository contains the full specification, mathematics, simulations, engine, papers,  
and technical documentation of the KCM model.

## 3. CORE CONCEPTS OF KCM

### **0–1–C Law**
The universal dynamic all systems follow:

- **1 →** instability spreads  
- **C →** collapse resolves  
- **0 →** stability restores  

### **C-State Core**  
Defines how and when collapse occurs using:
- contradiction thresholds  
- stability energy  
- symmetry constraints  
- minimal-time selection  

### **KRP Roots (MR → RR → TR → TmR)**  
Every decision follows four universal roots:
- MeaningRoot  
- RouteRoot  
- TrustRoot  
- TimeRoot  

These roots funnel any input into a collapse-ready form.

### **Collapse Math Foundation**  
Formal definitions for:
- E(x) = D(x) + C(x)  
- D(x): distance from center  
- C(x): contradiction magnitude  
- Symmetry requirement  
- Collapse-time minimization  

### **RH Mapping**  
Shows why non-trivial zeta zeros collapse to:

Re(s) = 1/2

This is the symmetry center of the zeta-wave system.

## 4. KCM ENGINE (Executable Collapse System)

The Python engine performs:

Input → KRP Analysis → Stability Math → C-State → Output

You can run it like this:

```python
from engine import KCMCollapseEngine, KRPMapper

signal = "Should a startup scale fast or grow steadily?"

krp = KRPMapper(
    meaning=70,
    route=60,
    trust=65,
    time_pressure=50
)

instability = 55

engine = KCMCollapseEngine(signal, krp, instability)
result = engine.collapse()

print(result)

5. KCM SIMULATOR (UI DEMO)

The web-based simulator demonstrates live 1→C→0 transformation:

Input any signal

Adjust Meaning, Routes, Trust, Time, Instability

Watch collapse type + stability analysis
