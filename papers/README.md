# KCM RESEARCH PAPERS — Whitepaper & RH Collapse Mapping  
### Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)  
**Author:** Saurabh Misra (Karnav)

---

## 1. PURPOSE  
The `/papers` directory contains the **formal research-level documents** of the  
**Karnav Collapse Model (KCM)**.

These papers explain:
- the full model architecture  
- philosophical foundations  
- formal mathematics  
- domain mappings  
- Riemann Hypothesis structural collapse theory  

These files are written in research-paper format, independent of the code and specs.

## 2. FILE INDEX

### **1. KCM-Whitepaper-v0.1.md**  
This is the **primary research introduction** to the Karnav Collapse Model.

It contains:

- complete 0–1–C overview  
- collapse-state mechanics  
- KRP intelligence system  
- collapse mathematics  
- AI, physics, logic, cognition, hardware mappings  
- full architecture diagrams  
- future directions  

This paper is intended as the **first document reviewers and researchers should read**.

---

### **2. RH-Collapse-Mapping-v0.1.md**  
This paper provides the **structural interpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH)**  
using KCM collapse mechanics.

It introduces:

- zeta as a wave-field  
- instability regions  
- symmetry-center constraints  
- collapse mathematics  
- reason zeroes collapse to Re(s) = 1/2  
- energy minimization & contradiction minimization  
- structural justification for RH  

This is the **mathematical core paper** connecting KCM to analytic number theory.

## 3. HOW THE PAPERS CONNECT TO SPECS

spec/KCM-v1.0.md          → Complete specification spec/0-1-C-Law.md         → Universal dynamics spec/C-State-Core.md      → Collapse mechanics spec/KRP-Roots.md         → Decision intelligence layer spec/Collapse-Math-Foundation.md → Mathematics of collapse papers/KCM-Whitepaper     → Full narrative + model papers/RH-Collapse-Mapping → Mathematical application

Together they form the **full research pack**:

- Theory  
- Architecture  
- Math  
- Application  
- Proof structure

## 5. VERSIONING  
Both papers follow semantic versions:

- `v0.1` = first public draft  
- `v0.x` = additions, clarifications  
- `v1.0` = post-review, final research docs  

Major mathematical expansions will happen in v1.x releases.

---

## 6. STATUS  
All papers required for KCM v1.0 launch are included & documented.  
Future work will add:

- deeper collapse mathematics  
- ε-elimination for RH  
- symmetry-energy theorems  
- collapse evolution graphs
